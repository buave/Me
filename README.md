### Hello ðŸ‘‹
## I'm just a student who loves development and CyberSecurity

- ðŸ‘“ The languages I know are: Python 3, PHP, Lua, JavaScript, C++ and Holy Rust (learning)
- ðŸŽ† As far as CyberSecurity is concerned, I am starting in this wonderful field.
- ðŸ˜´ I'm pretty lazy when it comes to putting my codes on GitHub so don't be surprised, same for the comments in my codes.
